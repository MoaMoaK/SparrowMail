## Introduction

SparrowMail is a web app written in python using [the framework Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org).  
The project goal is to be able to manage mails through a web interface such as quickly adding new mailboxes or edit filters for each mailbox.  
The project is currently designed for use with [postfix](http://www.postfix.org/) (configured with virtual user), [dovecot](https://dovecot.org/) and [pigeonhole](https://pigeonhole.dovecot.org/) (a dovecot plugin for sieve filters).

## Requirements

As the app is mainly written in python, a Python interpreter is mandatory. Works with python2.7.  
The app installation is done through pip so, this tool is needed for a simple installation. If not desired all needed packages can be installed manually but, finding the required one is the sole responsability of the user.  
As the app is meant to have a web interface, having a web server can be usefull.

## Production setup

For example :  
`sudo adduser sparrowmail --system`  
`sudo adduser sparrowmail dovecot`  
`sudo adduser sparrowmail postfix`  
`sudo adduser sparrowmail vmail`


Simply clone the git repository (as the newly create user) here you want it to be installed (must be installed on the mail server) :  
`sudo -u sparrowmail git clone https://moamoak@gitlab.rez-rennes.fr/moamoak/sparrowmail.git`  
And install it using pip :  
`sudo -u sparrowmail pip install sparrowmail/`

### Configuration

`sudo -u sparrowmail python init_sparrowmail.py`

### Starting the web server
